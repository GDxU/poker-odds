poker-odds is a program for calculating the odds in a Texas Hold 'Em poker
game.  It tells you how likely you are to make each category of hand.  For
example, it can tell you how likely it is that, if you start with two aces, you
will get four of a kind.

Currently, poker-odds only takes into account one player. You cannot augment it
with your knowledge, actual or suspected, about what other players hold (and
what therefore cannot be revealed by the dealer).

I wrote poker-odds partly to learn the Google Go (Golang) programming language.
poker-odds can be configured to use as many or as few goprocs as you like. More
goprocs means more parallelism, of course.

I hope you have fun with this and with Go!
