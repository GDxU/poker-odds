`%s: the Texas Hold Em' poker odds calculator.

This program calculates your 'outs' for a Texas Hold Em' poker hand.
Texas Hold Em' is a popular version of poker where each player receives
exactly two secret cards. Then there are five rounds of betting.

The format used to specify cards is as follows:
[type][suit]
There are 4 suits:
C = clubs, D = diamonds, H = hearts, S = spades
There are 13 different card types:
1 = A = ace, K = king, Q = queen, J = jack, 2 = 2, ... 10 = 10

Usage:
-a [your hand as a whitespace-separated list of cards]
-b [the board as a whitespace-separated list of cards]
If no -b is given, it will be assumed that no cards are on the board.
-h this help message

Usage Example:
%s -a KS\ QS
Find the outs you have pre-flop with a king and queen of spades.

/* Assumptions: we are the only players in the game
 * (Future enhancement: allow the user to specify cards that other players hold!)
 * 
 * 1. Get inputs
 * a. your hand (required)
 * b. the board (0 cards, 3 , 4, or 5 cards)
 *         Other numbers of cards represent errors
 *         (Future enhancement: support other poker games besides Texas Hold em')
 * 
 * 2. for all possible 'setups':
 *        for all hands in the setup:
 *              add the hand to the hand set
 *
 *    A poker hand is always 5 cards. The 'setup' is which cards we use from
 *    the hole, which cards we use from the board, and which cards we use from
 *    the 'future'. Of course, we don't know what the future will hold. That's
 *    why a single setup will contain more than one hand, if it uses future
 *    cards.
 *
 *    If the board contains 5 cards, then there is no future (all the
 *    cards that are going to come out have already come out) and the
 *    calculation is simple. If the board has 0 cards, there will be a lot of
 *    possibilities! Actually, though, you can still do this calculation in the
 *    comfort of your own home, using the wonderfully fast computers that
 *    we have access to now.
 *
 * 3. print out the hand set, or possibly just the best part of it.
